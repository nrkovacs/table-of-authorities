  "body_text": "INTRODUCTION\n[Formatting: Text should be double-spaced, left-justified, and with an indent\nat the beginning of each paragraph. Quotations more than two lines long may be\nindented and single-spaced, and headings and footnotes may be single-spaced.\nMargins must be at least one inch on all four sides. Page numbers may be placed\nin the margins, but no text may appear there].\n[Font: Either a proportionally spaced or a monospaced face may be used\n(acceptable examples include Times New Roman, Georgia, and Century\nSchoolbook). A proportionally spaced face must include serifs, but sans-serif type\nmay be used in headings and captions. A proportionally spaced face must be 14-\npoint or larger, while a monospaced face may not contain more than 10 1\u20442\ncharacters per inch. Do not use a smaller font for footnotes.]\n[Type Styles: A brief must be set in a plain, roman style, although italics or\nboldface may be used (sparingly) for emphasis. Case names must be italicized or\nunderlined.]\n[Practice Tip: Although neither the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure\nnor the Ninth Circuit Rules require an introduction, both allow one, and\neffective briefs often include one. Writing an introduction allows you to\nsuccinctly (no more than 2 pages) introduce the basic facts and law the Court\nneeds to understand to rule your way. Consider asking yourself, \u201cIf I had\none minute to tell another lawyer who is not an expert in this subject area\nwhat this appeal is all about and why my client should win, what would I\nsay?\u201d]\nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT1\n[Insert a sentence or short paragraph describing: (1) the basis for jurisdiction\nfor the lower court, agency or board, with reference to the specific statute\nconferring jurisdiction (e.g., 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331); (2) the basis for jurisdiction for the\nCourt of Appeals, with reference to the specific statute conferring jurisdiction (e.g.,\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291); (3) the date of entry of the judgment or order appealed from;\nthe date of filing of the notice of appeal or petition for review; and the statute or\nrule under which it is claimed the appeal is timely; and (4) whether the appeal is\nfrom a final order or judgment that disposes of all parties\u2019 claims, or information\nestablishing the court of appeals\u2019 jurisdiction on some other basis.]\n[In a criminal case, include the defendant\u2019s bail status. If the defendant is in\ncustody, the projected release date should be included.]\n[In a petition for review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals,\nstate whether petitioner (1) is detained in the custody of the Department of\n1 If you are filing an answering brief, you do not need to include a jurisdictional\nstatement, the statement of issues, the statement of the case, or the standards of\nreview, if you agree entirely with the opening brief\u2019s discussion of those sections.\nIf you are filing a reply brief, you do not need to (and in fact should not) repeat the\njurisdictional statement, the statement of issues, the statement of the case, or the\nstandards of review section(s). Moreover, you should not simply repeat arguments\nmade in your opening brief, but instead respond to your opponent\u2019s responses.\n2\nHomeland Security or at liberty and/or (2) has moved the Board of Immigration\nAppeals to reopen or applied to the district director for an adjustment of status.]\n[Practice Tip: Include citations to the excerpts of record to establish the\ntimeliness of the appeal.]\nSTATUTORY [AND REGULATORY] AUTHORITIES\n[Although not required under the rules, you may reproduce the text of the\ngoverning constitutional, statutory, or regulatory authority here. Doing so,\nhowever, will count against the total number of words in the brief. Alternatively,\nyou may include a sentence like, \u201cAll relevant statutory [and/or constitutional\nand/or regulatory] authorities appear in the Addendum to this brief\u201d; text of the\nrelevant provisions in an Addendum is not counted against the word count.]\nISSUE(S) PRESENTED\n[Identify the issue or issues that you are presenting to the Court of Appeals.]\n[Practice Tip: In listing the issue(s) presented, tell the Court what the issues\nare in a brief and succinct way \u2013 preferably one that suggests the answer you\nwant without being too argumentative, such as \u201cWhether the district court\nerred in holding that Plaintiff lacked standing where he sufficiently alleged\nthat Defendant\u2019s conduct directly caused him to lose his job.\u201d Each issue\npresented should be one sentence long. If there is more than one issue,\nnumber each one. Ideally, to guide the Court, each issue presented would\nmap on to each major argument heading (i.e., the Roman numeral headings\nbelow), so if the Argument section contains parts I, II, and III, there would\nbe three issues presented listed here.]\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n[Insert a concise statement of the case setting out the facts relevant to the\nissues submitted for review, describing the relevant procedural history, and\nidentifying the rulings presented for review, with appropriate references to the\nrecord (see FRAP 28(e)).]\n[Practice Tip: \u201cEvery assertion in the briefs regarding matters in the record,\nexcept for undisputed facts offered only for general background, shall be\nsupported by a citation to the Excerpts of Records, unless the filer is exempt\nfrom the excerpts requirement.\u201d See Ninth Cir. R. 28-2.8. In Social\nSecurity Appeals, the parties should cite to the certified administrative\nrecord as well as the excerpts of record. See Ninth Cir. R. 30-1.6 and 30-\n1.4(e). In immigration cases, the parties should cite to the certified\nadministrative record and addendum containing the relevant orders. See\nNinth Cir. R. 28-2.7. Citations should be in the form [volume number (if\nmore than one)]-[ER (or SER or FER for supplemental and further excerpts\nof record)]-[page number(s)]\u2014for example, 2-ER-345, or ER-67 (for a\nsingle-volume ER), or 1-SER-234 (for the first volume of a multivolume\nSER). See Ninth Cir. R. 30-1.6. These should be specific citations to\nparticular pages of the excerpts of record to which the Court can refer (e.g.,\n\u201c1-ER-234\u201336\u201d), not large page ranges. Best practice is to include a specific\nrecord citation after every sentence in the Statement. Failure to adequately\ncite to the record may result the Court striking your brief.\nThe statement of the case is your first real opportunity to draw the reader in,\nexplain what the case is about, and convince the reader to care about it. It\nshould read like a story of what happened, not a minute order summarizing\nthe proceedings below. Tell a story that is interesting, compelling, and\nmakes the reader want to side with your client.\nGenerally, the statement of the case should include the facts relied upon in\nyour argument section. However, you need not include every detail in the\n4\nstatement of facts. You can elaborate further in the argument section when\ndoing so will make it easier for the reader to digest the additional detail.\nDon\u2019t avoid inconvenient facts. If you leave out an important fact that\nseems to benefit your opponent, the judges will notice the omission, and\nthey will start to wonder if you are omitting other relevant information as\nwell. If the judges start doubting your credibility as they read your\nstatement of the case, you will be in trouble by the time they get to your\nlegal argument.]\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n[Insert a summary of the argument(s), which must (1) contain a succinct,\nclear, and accurate statement of the arguments made in the body of the brief, and\n(2) not merely repeat the argument headings.]\n[Practice Tip: To guide the reader, the summary of argument should\ngenerally follow the same organization as the Argument section. It can be\neffective to begin each paragraph in the Summary with the Roman numeral\n(e.g., \u201cII.\u201d) of the Argument section summarized by the paragraph.]\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n[Concisely state the applicable standard of review for each issue presented,\nincluding a citation of the relevant statute or Ninth Circuit decision setting forth the\nstandard. In addition, if you are the party disputing a ruling on appeal, and the\nruling is one to which a party must have objected at trial to preserve a right of\nreview, e.g., a failure to admit or to exclude evidence, or the giving of or refusal to\ngive a jury instruction, state where in the record on appeal the objection and ruling\nare set forth.]\n5\nARGUMENT\nI. [Insert appropriate heading for the argument on issue #1]\n[There are several acceptable ways to use capitalization in your argument\nheadings. Some attorneys prefer to use sentence case (capitalizing only the first\nletter of the first word, as above) for all headings because it tends to be easiest to\nread. Other attorneys prefer to use all uppercase for major headings, title case\n(capitalizing the first letter of every word) for subheadings, and sentence case for\nthe remaining headings. The choice is yours.]\n[Insert your first argument: this must include an identification of your\ncontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of\nthe record on which the appellant relies]\n[Practice Tip: Begin the argument section of your brief with your strongest\nargument. Omit implausible or weak arguments. Be straightforward about\nthe case\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and address weaknesses head on. If you\nare the appellant, don\u2019t just argue why you are right, explain why the district\ncourt got it wrong. Address case or statutory authority relied on by the\nlower court. Don\u2019t waste time arguing obvious or undisputed points. Don\u2019t\nuse boilerplate, especially regarding well-established standards, but if there\nis a controlling standard, include it.]\n[Practice Tip: There are two acceptable ways to address the standard of\nreview. See FRAP 28(a)(8)(B). You can include a standalone \u201cStandard of\nReview\u201d section before your \u201cArgument\u201d section, as illustrated above. See\nFRAP 28(a)(8)(B). Or you can begin each major section of your argument\nwith a subsection that addresses the standard of review for that particular\nissue. This option may be particularly appropriate when your brief presents\nnumerous issues with different applicable standards or if the standard of\nreview is disputed, complex, or dispositive.]\n6\n[Practice Tip: The Ninth Circuit\u2019s website includes an outline of standards\nof review, which can be a useful starting point for your research.\nhttp://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000368]\nB. [Insert appropriate subheading for the subargument on the first\nissue]\n[Using subheadings within major arguments can help guide the reader\nthrough the progression of your argument. For clarity, try to avoid including more\nthan three levels of subheadings (e.g., I/A/1). Two levels should generally suffice.\nMake your arguments here. Do not incorporate by reference briefs or pleadings\nfiled before the district court, or before this Court in a prior appeal.]\n[Text]\n1. [Insert appropriate subheading for the sub-subargument on\nissue #1.B.1, if this level of headings is necessary]\n[Text]\n2. [Insert appropriate subheading for the sub-subargument on\nissue #1.B.2]\n[Text]\nII. [Insert appropriate heading for the argument on issue #2]\n[Insert your second argument (if applicable). Repeat for each additional\nargument.]\nCONCLUSION\n[Insert a short conclusion stating the precise relief sought from the Court,\nsuch as \u201cFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court should be\n7\nreversed, and the case remanded for trial [or for an evidentiary hearing, for\nconsideration of Plaintiff\u2019s claims on the merits, etc.].\u201d]\n[Practice Tip: Generally, the conclusion should contain one sentence that\ntells the Court specifically what you want it to do and what directions it\nshould give the district court.]\nDate: [insert date]\n[Insert Counsel\u2019s name or firm name]\n/s/ [insert name of counsel filing brief]\n[insert name(s) of Counsel]\nAttorneys for Appellant [insert name of\nclient]\n8\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\nForm 17.

Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985).\n2 ROA.1002-1024; ROA.1030-1031.\n16\nISSUES PRESENTED\nThis qualified immunity appeal raises questions regarding the application of\nprobable cause in multi-suspect cases.\n1. Plaintiffs\u2019 Allegations Against Reyna Are Insufficient to Establish a\nConstitutional Violation or a Violation of Clearly Established Law\nA. Have Plaintiffs alleged a sufficient factual basis to support a claim\nthat Reyna arrested them or caused them to be arrested?\nB. Was it clearly established on May 17, 2015, that law enforcement\nofficers are prohibited from arresting a member of a large, riotous\ngroup, some of whom had been observed publicly committing violent\ncrimes resulting in multiple deaths, unless the officers can identify\nspecific unlawful acts attributable to the specific individual group\nmembers?\nC. Can Plaintiffs identify controlling authority establishing beyond\ndebate that their arrests were clearly prohibited?\n2. Qualified Immunity from Plaintiffs\u2019 Three Remaining Claims\nA. Is Reyna entitled to immunity from Plaintiffs\u2019 Franks claims?\n1. Have Plaintiffs alleged a sufficient factual basis to support a\nclaim that Reyna signed or presented an affidavit to a\nmagistrate which caused them to be arrested?\n17\n2. Have Plaintiffs alleged a sufficient factual basis to support a\nclaim that Reyna provided false information to anyone to be\nused in an affidavit or that he omitted material information\nfrom anyone in connection with their arrests?\n3. Was it a violation of clearly established law for Reyna to\nprovide legal advice to law enforcement officers regarding the\nelements of the offense of Engaging in Organized Criminal\nActivity?\nB. Is Reyna entitled to immunity from Plaintiffs\u2019 bystander claims?\n1. Did Plaintiffs properly assert a bystander claim?\n2. Did Plaintiffs allege sufficient facts to establish that Reyna was\npresent when the alleged Franks violation occurred and had a\nreasonable opportunity to prevent the violation from occurring?\n3. Was it clearly established at the time that an official could be\nheld liable under a bystander claim for failing to prevent a\nFranks violation?\nC. Is Reyna entitled to Immunity from Plaintiffs\u2019 Conspiracy Claims?\n1. Did Plaintiffs allege facts sufficient to establish an agreement\nbetween private and public defendants to commit an illegal act?\n18\n2. Did Plaintiffs allege facts sufficient to establish Reyna\u2019s\npersonal involvement in the alleged conspiracy?\n3. Did Plaintiffs allege facts sufficient to rebut Reyna\u2019s\nentitlement to immunity?\n19\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nPlaintiffs Bradley Terwilliger, Benjamin Matcek, and Jimmy Don Smith\n(\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) were arrested for the felony offense of Engaging in Organized\nCriminal Activity (\u201cEIOCA\u201d). EIOCA is a criminal enterprise offense, under\nwhich an individual may be held liable for acting \u201cin a combination\u201d with others\nwho commit or conspire to commit certain violent crimes.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 arrests occurred after a battle took place at a Twin Peaks\nrestaurant on May 17, 2015, between rival motorcycle clubs and affiliated\npersonnel, during which nine people were killed and many more were injured.3\nPlaintiffs admit that they are members of or associated with a motorcycle club and\nthat they were wearing clothing that reflected motorcycle club affiliation or support\nwhen they were present at the Twin Peaks restaurant on the day of the battle.4\nNevertheless, Plaintiffs claim that their arrests violated their constitutional\nrights because they were not supported by probable cause.5 Plaintiffs sued Abel\nReyna, the former District Attorney of McLennan County, Texas, as well as\nothers.6 Plaintiffs alleged that the District Attorney\u2019s Office set the criteria for\nestablishing probable cause to arrest individuals in connection with the mass\n3 ROA.485 [\u00b645]; ROA.529-530.\n4 Infra at 44-45.\n5 ROA.476-530.\n6 ROA.478-481.\n20\nviolence that occurred at the restaurant but that law enforcement personnel applied\nthose criteria.7\nReyna sought dismissal of all claims, asserting his entitlement to qualified\nimmunity.8 On September 6, 2019, the District Court entered an order granting in\npart and denying in part Reyna\u2019s motion to dismiss.9 The District Court denied\nReyna\u2019s motion as to Plaintiffs\u2019: (1) Franks; (2) conspiracy; and (3) bystander\nclaims. Reyna filed his notice of appeal on September 25, 2019.10\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\nThe battle at Twin Peaks involved multiple suspects in two warring groups\nand clear criminal conduct by members of those groups.\nA. Reyna is Entitled to Qualified Immunity From All of Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claims against Reyna should be dismissed because his conduct did\nnot violate clearly established law. He did not arrest Plaintiffs or cause them to be\narrested. But even if he had, he would still be entitled to qualified immunity\nbecause, at the time of the homicides at Twin Peaks, it was not clearly established\nthat Plaintiffs\u2019 arrests violated the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court and\nnumerous appellate courts have called into serious question how the notion of\n\u201cparticularized probable cause\u201d should be applied in multi-suspect cases.\n7 ROA.491 [\u00b668, n.3].\n8 ROA.562-710.\n9 ROA.1002-1023.\n10 ROA.1030-1031.\n21\nB. Plaintiffs\u2019 Franks Claims\nReyna is entitled to qualified immunity from Plaintiffs\u2019 Franks claims\nbecause Reyna was not a signer, presenter, provider, or omitter. He did not sign an\naffidavit. He did not present an affidavit. He did not provide false factual\ninformation to anyone to be used in an affidavit, and he did not omit any material\ninformation. All he is alleged to have done is to provide legal advice to law\nenforcement officers regarding the elements of the offense of Engaging in\nOrganized Criminal Activity (\u201cEIOCA\u201d). He allegedly provided officers with a set\nof criteria to be applied in determining whether an individual should be arrested for\nEIOCA. At most, he provided legal advice. He did not provide facts, and he did\nnot omit material facts. The facts were supplied by law enforcement.\nC. Plaintiffs\u2019 Bystander Claims\nReyna is entitled to qualified immunity from Plaintiffs\u2019 bystander claims\nbecause: (1) Plaintiffs failed to properly assert a bystander claim; (2) Plaintiffs\nfailed to allege facts sufficient to establish that Reyna was present when the alleged\nFranks violation occurred and that he had a reasonable opportunity to prevent the\nviolation from occurring; and (3) it was not clearly established at the time that an\nofficial could be held liable under a bystander claim for failing to prevent a Franks\nviolation.\nD. Plaintiffs\u2019 Conspiracy Claims\n22\nReyna is entitled to qualified immunity from Plaintiffs\u2019 conspiracy claims\nbecause: (1) Plaintiffs failed to allege facts sufficient to establish an agreement\nbetween private and public defendants to commit an illegal act; (2) Plaintiffs failed\nto allege facts sufficient to establish Reyna\u2019s personal involvement in the alleged\nconspiracy; and (3) Plaintiffs failed to allege facts sufficient to rebut Reyna\u2019s\nentitlement to immunity.\nARGUMENT\nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nA denial of a motion to dismiss is subject to de novo review.11\nII. MOTION TO DISMISS STANDARD\nA plaintiff must plead sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a\nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.12 A plaintiff\u2019s obligation in response to\na motion to dismiss is to provide the grounds for his entitlement to relief which\nrequires more than labels and conclusions; a formulaic recitation of the elements of\na cause of action will not suffice.13 A plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to create\nmore than a mere possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.14 A court is not\n11 Morin v.

PROBABLE CAUSE\nTo determine whether an officer had probable cause for an arrest, courts\nexamine the events leading up to the arrest and then decide whether these historical\nfacts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer,\namount to probable cause.20 In doing so, facts must not be viewed in isolation, but\n15 Papasan v.

Ct. 577, 586, 585 (2018) (citing Maryland\nv. Pringle, 540 U.S. 366, 371 (2003)).\n24\nshould be seen as factors in the totality of the circumstances, which requires the\ncourt to look at the \u201cwhole picture.\u201d21 Because probable cause \u201cdeals with\nprobabilities and depends on the totality of the circumstances,\u201d22 it is \u201ca fluid\nconcept\u201d that is \u201cnot readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal\nrules.\u201d23 It requires only a substantial chance of criminal activity, not an actual\nshowing of such activity.\u201d24 Probable cause \u201cis not a high bar.\u201d25\n\u2018\u201c[T]he relevant inquiry is not whether particular conduct is \u2018innocent\u2019 or\n\u2018guilty\u2019, but the degree of suspicion that attaches to particular types of noncriminal\nacts.\u2019\u201d26 Generally, the issuance of a warrant breaks the chain of causation in a\nwrongful arrest claim.27\nIV. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nGovernmental officials are protected from suit and liability by qualified\nimmunity unless their alleged conduct: (1) violated a Constitutional or statutory\nright; and (2) the illegality of the alleged conduct was clearly established at the\ntime.28 The phrase \u201cclearly established\u201d means that, at the time of the official\u2019s\nconduct, the law was sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would\n21 Wesby, at 588.\n22 Pringle, 540 U.S. at 371.\n23 Illinois v.
